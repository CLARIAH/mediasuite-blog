<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This one-week event, organized by CLARIAH (Media studies team) introduces scholars from different domains to the CLARIAH Media Suite and other tools which support the exploration, search and analysis of important <em>Dutch</em> audio-visual collections and their contextual data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the summer school, participants will follow tutorials about using the CLARIAH Media suite in combination with other tools for data analysis and visualization. </span><span class="s1">The Media Suite (<a href="https://clariah.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4aa8a65873d3ffafe259b732d&amp;id=1c03ddfa2c&amp;e=945d5a62a7"><span class="s4">http://mediasuite.clariah.nl/</span></a>) offers a user-friendly research environment with tools that support the research process, following the principles of data transparency. It provides facilities to search, browse, and work with manual &amp; and automatic annotations and enrichments (such as automatic speech recognition).
